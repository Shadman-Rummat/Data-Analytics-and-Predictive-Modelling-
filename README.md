# Data-Analytics-and-Predictive-Modelling
In this module, I achieved the class highest with an overall score of 85%.
For this project, I used "Dataset for estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition in individuals from Colombia, Peru, and Mexico" by Fabio Mendoza Palechor
and Alexis de la Hoz Manotas ([link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340919306985#bib1))

A "Machine Learning" approach was taken using a blend of KDD and CRISP-DM 
After the "Literature Review," out of 16 Features, 8 Main Features were chosen for analysis of obesity within individuals.
